# AI Healthcare Scan Analyzer

**Short description:**  
A simple web app that allows users to upload medical scans (images) and returns automated predictions/analysis using a trained deep learning model. Built for demonstration and prototype use — intended to show end-to-end MLOps and applied AI skills.

---

## Demo / 1-line pitch
**Pitch:** "An end-to-end AI prototype that accepts a medical scan upload, runs a preprocessed CNN model, and returns a prediction and confidence score — built with Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow/PyTorch."

---

## Features
- Upload image scans (JPEG/PNG)
- Preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize)
- Model inference that outputs predicted label + confidence
- Simple REST API (FastAPI) for integration
- Logging of requests and predictions (basic)
- Example client script and test images included

---

## Tech stack
- Python 3.9+  
- FastAPI (web API)  
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (model file included or downloadable)  
- uvicorn (ASGI server)  
- NumPy, Pillow (image handling)  
- Optional: Docker for containerized run
